Objectives:

- Every new phase adds income to the GOLD counter

- Implement Bank Options from game doc

- Implement 'Upkeep' function AKA resetting everything for the new phase.



Notes for next time:

- Events like upkeep should occur at the highest level (within the script for the passive phase)
	and trickle down into individual elements.
	This can be done by sending a signal from the HUD to the Passive Phase script
	to activate upkeep, then change individual elements there.
